# Part 1 - Resistors, capacitors, and recording fundamentals 

## Floating Inputs 

Before building circuits, it is important to understand what happens to an electrical node that is not connected to a defined voltage—a state known as a **floating** input.

**Exercise 1-1**

Connect an oscilloscope probe to **Channel 1** of your oscilloscope. Leave the other end of the wire completely disconnected (floating in the air). Set the oscilloscope scale to a sensitive vertical range (e.g., $50\,\text{mV/div}$ or $100\,\text{mV/div}$).

- What do you see? Why? What happens if you shake the wire around?

Connect the ground of the oscilloscope (the tiny crocodile clamp) to the signal input on the same channel.

- What happens to the noise? Why? What happens when you move the probe?


**Voltage divider:**

A voltage divider is an electrical circuit that outputs a fraction of
the input voltage it receives. Consider the circuit below.

The current going through $R_{1}$, also passes through $R_{2}$. We'll
call this current $I$. According to Ohm's law:

$V_{in\ } = I\ {(R}_{1}\  + \ R_{2})$

$V_{out}\  = \ I\ R_{2}$

Therefore:

$V_{out}\  = \ \frac{R_{2}}{(R_{1} + R_{2})}V_{in}$

The ratio between the $V_{out}$ and $V_{in}$ depends on the values of
the resistors $R_{1}$and $R_{2}$. Note that this ratio is always less
than one. Voltage dividers are passive circuits, they don't have their
own power source, and as such, can only attenuate the voltage. In order
to amplify voltages, we need active parts, as we will see in the
following sections.

**Exercise 1-1** - Build a voltage divider as shown in the above
circuit, where $V_{in}$is the voltage between the positive supply
voltage and the ground (15v). Use $R_{1}\  = \ R_{2}\  \approx \ 1\ kOhm$, and
measure $V_{out}$.

- What is $V_{out}$?

- Change $R_{2}$ to a resistor with a lower value, e.g. $300\ Ohm$. What is $V_{out\ }$now?

**Exercise 1-2** - Next, we need to get comfortable with our
oscilloscope because we are going to be using it a lot over the next
couple days.

Our scopes have 2 input channels, and one signal generator (barely)
capable of making an analog voltage. Either of the inputs can be sent
through a threshold to capture the signals collected on both channels in
the vicinity of the trigger event.

Connect a BNC cable between channel 1 (orange port) and the voltage
generator (green port). Hit CONF on channel one and use the arrow and OK
buttons to select the following options

- Probe: 1x (BNC cable)

- Coupling: DC

- FFT: Off

Next, we will generate a sinusoidal wave to simulate some interesting
signal from the brain. Press the GEN button on the scope to pull up the
function generator menu. You can then change the settings to output
period voltage waveforms of different types, frequencies and duty cycles
using the arrow and OK keys at the top of the scope.

- Press GEN

- Set the type to Sine

- Set the frequency to 1 kHz

To ensure the signal is actually being produced, connect a BNC cable
between the output on the scope and one of the inputs on the scope.
Adjust your channel one's vertical settings to the following using its
knobs:

- DIV: 500 mV (this means 500 mV per vertical graticule)

- POS: 0V (this is the vertical offset voltage applied to the measured
  signal)

Adjust the horizontal settings to

- POS: 0 (you can press the ORIG button to get this setting)

- DIV: 500 μS (this means 500 μsec per horizontal graticule)

Finally, we need to adjust our trigger to capture this waveform:

- Mode: normal (only trigger when a threshold crossing occurs)

- Edge: rising

- Position: 0V

Make sure your scope is running by pressing the Run/Stop button. If all
has gone well you should see something like this on your screen:

**Exercise 1-3** - What happens if you put an electrode in the brain and
measure the output? In this exercise, we will build a simple circuit to
mimic this scenario. First we need to plug in our 10x probes to get
accurate measurements. Plug one into each input channel of the scope and
then configure them using the CONF button:

- Probe: 10x (make sure that the 10x switch is set on the probe itself)

- Coupling: DC

- FFT: Off

Now that we can make measurements and generate signals with our scope,
we want to measure the output from a simple electrode model. We consider
the following circuit as a simplified model of the electrode and the
measurement system.

![](./media/image23.png){: style="width: 2.6770833333333335in; height: 1.823520341207349in;" }

We imagine that the function generator on the scope (voltage source in
the image above) is a huge neuron. $R_{s}$ stands for the series
resistance of the electrode. $R_{sh}$is the shunt or parallel resistor
and represents the effective resistance along all possible paths through
which the current can flow to the ground through your recording system.

First, add $R_{s}$$= \ 10\ kOhm$ to the breadboard. Before completing
the circuit, use two oscilloscope probes along with the second channel
on the oscilloscope to measure the input voltage and $V_{out}$ after
'electrode series resistance'${\ R}_{s}$. How do the two voltage
measurements compare?

Next, complete your electrode model by adding $R_{sh}\  = \ 220\ Ohm$ to
the circuit. Using two oscilloscope probes, measure the voltage before
and after the 'electrode' ($V_{out}$ and the function generator output).
How much is the signal attenuated when measured?

This attenuation is to a large degree unavoidable. We'll see later how
this can be overcome.

**Exercise 1-4:** Next, we want to understand how capacitors store
charge and resist changes in voltage. On your breadboard, build the
following circuit.

Measure the voltage across the capacitor using the oscilloscope. What is
it?

With your probes attached to the circuit, disconnect the lead from +5V
to the circuit.![](./media/image16.png){: style="width: 4.46875in; height: 2.408546587926509in;" }

\- LED

- What happens to the LED?

- What happens to the voltage on the scope? Why? (Hint: there is a first
  and second-order answer to this question, a full explanation requires
  considering the LEDs I/V characteristics which you can look into if
  you want :)
